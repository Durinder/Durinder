### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I have spent the majority of my studying life in the Faculty of Law at Helsinki University. However, the call of natural science was far too culling and I have put my legal studies on hold and have moved to computer sciences.

I have studied at [Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/en/).

Currrently working as an Intern at Unity.
