### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I have spent the majority of my studying life in the Faculty of Law at Helsinki University. However, the call of natural science was far too culling and I have put my legal studies on hold and have moved to computer sciences.

I started stuydying amongst the first students at [Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/en/) in 2019. The school follows the [42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(school)) education model.
